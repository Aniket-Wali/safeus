In our webapp, we are creating two interfaces, one for the buyers' and other for the sellers. We would be taking shop opening and closing time and time required per customer for one transaction. With the help of this data, we would provide slots to users so that as per the slot given time the shop would be empty of other customers. Slots would be given as per availability, availability of commodities needed (by the user) and seller's permission.

It would also help social workers who are arranging food and other commodities for charity and distribution among the less-priviledged as they could pre-book a slot and arrange their huge requirement of goods at an empty shop (with no crowd) in an easy and hassle-free manner.

Domains under focused seller: local store, pharmacy, ration shop, milk dairy, drinking water, boutique, bakery, grocery, doctor clinic, etc.
 
By this, their won't be any crowd and smooth marketing will take place in a well disciplined manner. Complete eradication of waiting time and roaming of people from one shop to another in search of their commodity. At last we strongly believe that this way we can stop and slow down the spread of the virus.
